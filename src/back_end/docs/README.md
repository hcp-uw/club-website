General README for these functions... we can fill it out at some point @Ben
But for now I will use this as a TODO list.

Ben:
- Return active club leads              (TODO)
- Return shortened form of projects     (TODO)
- Endpoint Documentation                (TODO)

Frank:
- Return old events / upcoming events   (This PR)
- Return details for projects           (TODO)
- Return all currently active projects  (TODO)
- Endpoint Documentation                (TODO)

General:
- Refactoring code, we need to split up the `end_points.js` file into three files. More on this after we're done with the main features (low on priority)
